The usage of open source software is becoming increasingly common. While open source software has several benefits, its usage has to be carefully supervised. All open source software is governed by licenses. Licenses are legal documents that dictate the limits of using a software. Before using open source software adequate research has to be done to study the license terms, existing vulnerabilities and see if the software can be used within the guidelines of the corporate policy.
 
This project is aimed at developing a system that software developers and managers can use to scan open source software licenses and gather information about licenses and vulnerabilities of software. This system will scan a given software and run checks against NIST databases to gather license information. The gathered information is stored in a licenses and vulnerabilities database from which developers and managers can retrieve software license and vulnerability information. Managers can also use this system to create, edit and retrieve corporate policies for open source software usage.
