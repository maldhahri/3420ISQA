The usage of open source software is becoming increasing common. While open source software has several benefits, its usage has to be carefully supervised. All open source software are governed by  licenses. Licenses are legal documents that dictate the limits of using a software. 

This project is aimed at developing a system that software developers and managers can use to scan open source software licenses and gather information about licenses and vulnerabilities of software. This system will scan a given software and run checks against NIST databases to gather license information. The gathered information is used to ensure license adherence. The system will also check software packages with company policy.
